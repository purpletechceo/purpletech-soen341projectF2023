Sprint 1 Summary:
We began the Sprint 1 Planning Meeting with Shah summarizing the key requirements for this initial sprint. This summary provided a clear understanding of our objectives and goals, ensuring that everyone was aligned with the sprint's scope.

Collaborative Google Doc:
Our team collectively engaged in adding relevant information and project details into a shared Google Doc. This collaborative document was established as a central repository to streamline the organization of project-related information.

Read Me File Update:
Recognizing the importance of accessibility, we decided to transfer pertinent information from the Google Doc into the project's Read Me file. This step ensures that essential project details are easily accessible to all team members and stakeholders. Here, we align with the GitHub repository's description, which stated: "This repository will contain all documents related to your project such as README file, project reports, meeting minutes, user stories, etc."

Task Distribution:
To facilitate an efficient development process, tasks were thoughtfully distributed among team members based on their roles, strengths, and areas of expertise. The breakdown of tasks ensures that each team member has a specific focus and responsibilities aligned with their roles.

Open Questions and Discussion Topics:
During the meeting, several important questions and topics were discussed:

User Stories & Project Approach and Technology: We deliberated on the format for submitting user stories, contemplating whether they should be included in the wiki or the Read Me file. Questions were raised regarding the extent of detail needed for project approach and technology research, including whether to provide justifications for choosing a particular framework and whether a framework decision should be made at this stage.
Requirements for Sprint 2: We acknowledged the need for more specific requirements for Sprint 2 and discussed how to structure the content effectively.
Clarification on "Installation of Software in Read Me": We sought clarification on the meaning of "installation of software in Read Me."
